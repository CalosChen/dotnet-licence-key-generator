# .NET Licence Key Generator

## Key Generation and Verification System component for Microsoft .NET applications (.NET 2.0 and above) ##

A common requirement for software vendors is the inclusion of a system for generating and verifying passwords, which can be bundled with distributed desktop software, or for granting access to online services. App Software's .NET Licence Engine SDK provides a robust, lightweight and tested means of solving this problem.

The .NET Licence Engine SDK implements a 'Partial Number Verification System', which along with other features, provides a defence against key generators which may be built to attempt to crack your licence key system.

### Key benefits of implementing your licence system with the .NET Licence Key Generator are: ###

No 'Phone Home' to verify licence keys is required.
Ability to revoke licence keys if keys found to have been distributed without authorisation.
Compiled key verification code cannot be fully reproduced to allow the creation of a key generator (keygen).
Keys can be bound to a particular product version if required.

### Additional benefits:

Light weight and fast code execution, tested up to 1,000,000 key generation and verification cycles in 10.2 seconds.
Simple to use SDK and sample projects included.
30 day free trial available.
